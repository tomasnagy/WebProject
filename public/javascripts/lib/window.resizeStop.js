/**
 window.resizeStop emulates a "resizestop" event on the window object.
 This is useful for performing actions that depend on the window size, but are expensive in one way or another - i.e. heavy DOM manipulation or asset loading that might be detrimental to performance if run as often as resize events can fire.
 The library-agnostic version assumes the best-case - full support for a number of methods that older or non-DOM-compliant browsers may not support.
 Support for the following is assumed:
 Date.now()
 Array.prototype.indexOf()
 window.addEventListener()

 You may need to tweak this to work cross-browser or with your library or existing application.
